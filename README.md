# Project 1: College Recruitment Improvement Study

## Purpose of the Project:
This project aims to analyze survey data collected from non-major students at CCM (County College of Morris) to better understand their motivations, preferred outreach methods, interest in additional computing courses, and more. The insights gained from this analysis will help the Department of Information Technologies optimize their recruitment strategies, increase enrollment, and improve engagement with students. 

The data analysis and visualizations will also guide the department in focusing its efforts on areas that are most successful and identifying potential areas of improvement.
